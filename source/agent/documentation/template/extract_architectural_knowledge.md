## Context

- UML model: {model}. PlantUml specifications: {specification}.
- Root has "issueList": array of issue objects.
- Each issue has an array of alternatives.
- Each alternative has an array of influences.
- Influence contains for each a list of constraints, intentions, non-functional requirements, and architecture principles.
- Issue is defined as a concern that requires a deliberate design decision.
- Alternative is defined as a design choice that solves issues.
- Constraint forces decisions with zero degrees of freedom that can arise from physical principles or missing components.
- Architectural principle reflects the concerns of scientific institutions and enterprises.
- Intention reflects the concerns of individuals or small teams.
- Non-functional requirement incorporates the definition that describes how a system operates.
- Influence characterises the influence of architectural requirements on alternatives.
- Each concept must have exactly one "title" string.
- Always include all objects, even if empty.
