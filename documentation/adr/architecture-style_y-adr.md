# Y-Statement

In the context of the revision of the smart factory and 
its production station,

facing the increased complexity in experimental 
evaluations,

we decided to implement a service-based microservice
software architecture,

and neglected the existing monolithic software architecture,

to achieve: fault-tolerance, extensibility, and
maintainability, accepting that: 
codebase redundancy increases.
